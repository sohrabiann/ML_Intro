# Welcome
In this repository youâ€™ll find my programs I created in order to gather a deeper understanding of Machine Learning, AI, and Neural Networks.  These programs dive into many important ML theories of ML and helped me create a foundation.

Each file is a Jupyter Notebook written since in these programs I needed to constantly visualize my data with plots and outputs so its broken down in steps.
